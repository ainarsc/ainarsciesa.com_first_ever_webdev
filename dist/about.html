    <div class="about-me">

      <h3 class="font-weight-4x heading-font-size-sm no-side-padding">Where did it all start</h3>
      <p class="row">I have always wanted to travel long-term but to me it never seemed possible. I thought you have to be either rich or just have to save money for ten years but in 2015 I went on a guided backpacking trip to Indonesia. Right now I
        would never do guided travel like that but I had a full time job back home and I could only do a vacation. Also I really had no clue how easy it is to travel these days on your own. That trip really changed everything. I was already
        struggling with what I wanted to do in life, the 9-5 job I was doing at the time really wasn't doing it for me. I couldn't picture doing that sort of thing for rest of my life. After those three weeks I spent backpacking around Indonesia and
        seeing a bit of Thailand I was hooked. A plan to go to New Zealand on Working Holiday visa was already in works but the Indonesia trip left me thirsty to travel around South East Asia for few months.
      </p>
      <h3 class="font-weight-4x heading-font-size-sm">Leaving my Job</h3>
      <p class="row">
        In beginning of 2016 me, my cousin and his girlfriend applied for a New Zealand Working Holiday visa. We got it pretty fast though we didn't plan on flying to New Zealand in 2016 so we had some time to kill. I was itching to leave my job
        already and wanted to go somewhere before New Zealand and so we decided to go to Scotland for some time, unfortunately that idea never panned out. I had quit my job prematurely and wasn't sure what to do. So I got a temp job in a different
        bank back home in Latvia. As I was nearing end of my probation my cousin found a very enticing job offer in Iceland and I also wanted in since Iceland sounded like a blast. So it was time to break my contract and leave yet another job.
        Everything was so sudden and we left.

      <h3 class="font-weight-4x heading-font-size-sm">Trying to figure things out</h3>
      <p class="row">As part of my travels I wanted to learn Computer Science and be one of those self-taught programmers. I had been learning it for the past year before leaving for Iceland so I was on a good track to really stick to it during my
        travels despite all the obvious challenges. However it was significantly harder than I thought to stick to it at times and there were long stretches I had completely stopped working on it. At the same time there was a lot of doubt whether I
        have enough willpower to learn computer science on my own. Despite all that it's still one of my goals among many other things I want to do. All that has lead me here and I somehow forced myself to learn a bit of web development to build
        this site.</p>
        <h3 class="font-weight-4x heading-font-size-sm">Never stop growing</h3>
      <p class="row">During my time of travel I have grown and rediscovered myself like I never could have imagined had I stayed home. That's one of the many reasons I have no regrets about leaving home. I have picked up few new skills along the way
        as well. I learned quite a bit about photography, learned to play a guitar and ride a motorcycle among other things. I have met many amazing people from all over the world and seen and done many incredible things. I will always make travel
        my priority. </p>
