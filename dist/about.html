      <h3 class="font-weight-4x heading-font-size-sm no-side-padding h-secondary-color">Where did it all start</h3>
      <p class="row">I have always wanted to travel long-term, but to me it never seemed possible. I thought you either had to be rich or spend years slaving away saving money. However, in 2015 I went on a guided backpacking trip to Indonesia that
        changed everything. Looking back at all the experiences I’ve gained in travelling I would never do guided travel like that again now. Sadly back then I had a full time job at home in Latvia and I could only go on a short vacation. Also I
        really had no clue how easy it was to travel these days on your own. I was already struggling with what I wanted to do in life. The 9-5 job I was doing at the time really wasn't doing it for me. I couldn't picture doing that line of work for
        rest of my life. After those three weeks I spent backpacking around Indonesia and seeing a bit of Thailand I was hooked. A plan to go to New Zealand on a Working Holiday Visa was already in the works, but my Indonesia trip left me eager to
        travel around South East Asia again soon, but for longer.

      <h3 class="font-weight-4x heading-font-size-sm h-secondary-color">Leaving my Job</h3>
      <p class="row">
        In the beginning of 2016 my cousin, his girlfriend and I each applied for a New Zealand Working Holiday Visa. We all got accepted pretty fast, although we didn't plan on flying to New Zealand in 2016 so we had lots of time to kill. I was
        itching to leave my job and I wanted to go somewhere before New Zealand so we decided to go to Scotland. Unfortunately, that idea never panned out. I had quit my job prematurely and wasn't sure what to do so I got a temp job in a different
        bank back home in Latvia. As I was nearing the end of my probation my cousin found a very enticing job offer in Iceland. I also wanted to join him since Iceland sounded like a blast. So it was time to break my contract and leave yet another
        job. Everything was so sudden and we left.

      <h3 class="font-weight-4x heading-font-size-sm h-secondary-color">Trying to figure things out</h3>
      <p class="row">As part of my travels I wanted to learn Computer Science and be one of those self-taught programmers. Before leaving for Iceland I had been teaching myself coding for over a year so I was really motivated to keep learning and
        practicing during my travels despite all the obvious challenges. However, it was significantly harder than I thought. At times there were long stretches where I had completely stopped working on it. At the same time there was a lot of doubt
        whether I had enough willpower to learn Computer Science on my own. Despite all of the obstacles that I’ve faced, it's still one of my biggest goals among many other things I want to accomplish. All that has lead me here and I somehow forced
        myself to learn a bit of web development to build this site.
      </p>
      <h3 class="font-weight-4x heading-font-size-sm h-secondary-color">Never stop growing</h3>
      <p class="row">During my time traveling I have grown and rediscovered myself like I never could have imagined. It's one of the many reasons I have no regrets about leaving home. I have picked up a few new skills along the way as well. I
        learned quite a bit about photography, I learned how to play the guitar and I learned how to ride a motorcycle among other things. I have met so many amazing people from all over the world and I have seen and done so many incredible things.
        Traveling with always be a priority. </p>
